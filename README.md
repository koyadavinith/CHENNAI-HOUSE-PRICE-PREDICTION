# CHENNAI-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION

## Problem Statement
  Real estate transactions are quite opaque sometimes and it may be difficult for a newbie to 
  know the fair price of any given home. Thus, multiple real estate websites have the 
  functionality to predict the prices of houses given different features regarding it. 
  Such forecasting models will help buyers to identify a fair price for the home 
  and also give insights to sellers as to how to build homes that fetch them more money. 
  Chennai house sale price data is shared here and the participants are expected to build a
  sale price prediction model that will aid the customers to find a fair price for their 
  homes and also help the sellers understand what factors are fetching more money for the houses
